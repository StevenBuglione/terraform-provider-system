# Resource: system_packages_apt

`system_packages_apt` manages one or more apt packages on the remote system.

Use the `system_packages_apt` resource to manage packages on Debian systems.

-> The resource requires the `apt` package management.

## Usage

### Single package

This example ensures that the apt package `nginx` is installed.

```terraform
resource "system_packages_apt" "single" {
  package {
    name = "nginx"
  }
}
```

### Multiple packages

This example ensures that the apt packages `nginx` and `openssl` are installed.

```terraform
resource "system_packages_apt" "multiple" {
  package {
    name = "nginx"
  }

  package {
    name = "openssl"
  }
}
```

## Notes

This section describes general notes for using the `system_packages_apt` resource.

- The resource the remembers whether packages are installed at the time the resource is created.
- When the resource is deleted, only packages which have been installed by the resource will be removed.
- Avoid defining multiple `system_packages_apt` resources in the same Terraform configuration. Instead, manage all required packages in a single `system_packages_apt` resource.
