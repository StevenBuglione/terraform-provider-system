# Supported systems

The current version of the Terraform provider supports the following Linux distributions. Support for each distribution is verified by a comprehensive acceptance test suite.

- Alpine Linux 3
- Debian 11 (bullseye)
- Fedora 35

The provider may be compatible with other Linux distributions without coverage by acceptance tests.

Support for macOS may be added in future versions.

Support for Windows is not planned nor likely.
